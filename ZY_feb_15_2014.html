<!-- MAIN CONTENT -->  
<div id='start'></div>
<p>For today, I wanted to include a calendar here to kinda mark when I started.
    I defaulted to use the simplest shell script that I thought of : <code>$ CAL</code> </p>
<div id="screen_shot_1">
    <img class="text_width" src='./images/cal_uc_shell_script.png'>
</div>
<p>Oops, CAPS lock was turned on. It gave me an interesting result with the days oriented vertically, not what I wanted though.
    Try 2 : <code>$ cal</code></p>
<div id="screen_shot_2">
    <img class="text_width" src='./images/cal_lc_shell_script.png'>
</div>
<p>Hmm, I thought it would highlight "today". I was suprised to find out that <code>cal</code> in OSX <strong>doesn't</strong> highlight today by default.
    So, here's where I learnt a cool new script to make highlighting work!</p>
    <code>$cal | grep -C3 --color " $(date +%-d)"</code>
<p>Oh, I created an alias for it as well.</p> <code>$alias today='cal | grep -C3 --color " $(date +%-d)"'</code>
