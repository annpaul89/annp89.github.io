<p>
   Given a path of ((x1, y1), (x2, y2), ... (xn, yn)), finding the sum of the angle between consecutive line segments of the path
    in radians will give an idea of how variance a path has. 
</p>
<p>This helps to differentiate <em>jagged and squiggly paths </em>from lengthier and more leveled paths. This allows us to filter out noise or paths that we want to tailor to different use cases.
</p>
<pre>       
def get_total_angle(path):
    total_angle = 0.0

    for i in xrange(len(path)-2):
        point1 = path[i]
        point2 = path[i+1]
        point3 = path[i+2]

        angle = find_angle(point1, point2, point3)
        total_angle += angle
    return total_angle

</pre>
</p>
<p>
    In order to find the angle, I first went down the path of using the law of cosines and the in-built <code>math</code> library. Unfortunately, that didnt quite pan out since I kept running into issues of numeric instability. This is where the magic of scientific libraries in python like <strong>numpy</strong>, make our lives so much easier.

<pre>
def find_angle(point_a, point_b, point_c):
    """
    Expects arguments to be a list or tuple of length 2
    Returns the angle made at point_b in radians
    """
    # Any or all points are the same
    if point_a == point_b or point_b == point_c or point_a == point_c:
        return 0

    angle = (numpy.arctan2(point_c[0] - point_b[0], point_c[1] - point_b[1]) -
             numpy.arctan2(point_a[0] - point_b[0], point_a[1] - point_b[1]))

    if angle &gt; numpy.pi:
        return numpy.absolute(2 * numpy.pi - angle)

    if angle &lt; -numpy.pi:
        return numpy.absolute(2 * numpy.pi + angle)
    return numpy.absolute(angle)

</pre>
