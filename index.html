        <p>Today, I got to work with a friend to use Python libraries to scrape data from a Pokemon website
            [http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/].
            Since there's a lot of data and numbers associated with it,
            I thought it'd be fun to look into and explore. [Disclaimer: I do not play Pokemon and the most I know is that
            Pikachu is a very famous(?) Pokemon]</p>

        <p>The python packages needed are: <code>lxml</code> for HTML parsing and <code>urllib</code>
            to access the url as a HTML response.<p>
        <code>url = {url_name} <br>
            response = urllib.urlopen(url) <br>
            data = response.read() <br>
            tree = html.fromstring(data) <br>
        </code>
        <p>Essentially, we need to access the DOM element from which we want to scrap data using the xpath that leads to it. So if you've ever stumbled upon this path, </p>
        <p class="thick">Right click web-page -> Inspect Element -> Right on the HTML for the element you are searching, you'll notice an option called ->'Copy Xpath'.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, it won't work in some cases where the content you are searching for is in within a <code>table</code> tag.
        On inspecting the xpath, I noticed the <code>tbody</code> tag, which are tags inserted
        by the browser when not specified in the source code. So, I had to restructure the path, removing the tbody tags. </p>
        <p>
        Here's the xpath information for accessing a span element whose id is By_leveling_up, going up to the parent node, accessing a sibling node
          and then traversing down 2 nested tables using indexes and accessing the content from the td element at index 13 for all the tr elements in
          that table.
        </p>
        <p class="text_width">
         <pre> tree.xpath('//span[@id="By_leveling_up"]/../following-sibling::table[1]/
             tr[2]/td[1]/table[1]/tr/td[13]/a/span/text()')</pre>
        <p>

        <p>After my early morning run at 7 a.m., I was inspired to use and setup a github page for my profile; so here goes.
            I hope to update this page psuedo blog style page with code snippets or interesting links that I come across.</p>
        <p>For today, I wanted to include a calendar here to kinda mark when I started.
            I defaulted to use the simplest shell script that I thought of : <code>$ CAL</code> </p>
        <div id="screen_shot_1">
            <img class="text_width" src='./images/cal_uc_shell_script.png'>
        </div>
        <p>Oops, CAPS lock was turned on. It gave me an interesting result with the days oriented vertically, not what I wanted though.
            Try 2 : <code>$ cal</code></p>
        <div id="screen_shot_2">
            <img class="text_width" src='./images/cal_lc_shell_script.png'>
        </div>
        <p>Hmm, I thought it would highlight "today". I was suprised to find out that <code>cal</code> in OSX <strong>doesn't</strong> highlight today by default.
            So, here's where I learnt a cool new script to make highlighting work!</p>
            <code>$cal | grep -C3 --color "$(date +%d)"</code>
        <div id="screen_shot_3">
            <img class="text_width" src='./images/cal_highlight_script.png'>
        </div>
        <p>Oh, I created an alias for it as well.</p> <code>$alias today='cal | grep -C3 --color "$(date +%d)"'</code>
