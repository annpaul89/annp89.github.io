<!-- MAIN CONTENT -->
<p>
    In one of the projects I was working on, I was given a task to calculate the total number of paths(lines) that cross another line. This could be further broken down into finding the number of intersections made with the line of interest.
</p>

<p>
    Let me begin by explaining the solution before including Python.
</p>
    <pre>Src: <a href="http://compgeom.cs.uiuc.edu/~jeffe/teaching/373/notes/x06-sweepline.pdf">http://compgeom.cs.uiuc.edu/~jeffe/teaching/373/notes/x06-sweepline.pdf</a></pre></br><h5> Explanation: </h5> 
<p>
    Given 2 lines AB and CD, they intersect if and only if A and B are separated by segment CD and vice-versa. If so, ACD and BCD should have opposite orientation which means only one can be counterclockiwise.
</p>
<p>
    Determining the orientation of points can be done by using slopes. If slope of AB is less than AC, then ABC are listed in the counterclockwise order.

    <pre>def ccw(A,B,C): 
    return (B[1]-A[1])/(B[0]-A[0]) < (C[1]-A[1])/(C[0]-A[0])  
    </pre></p>
    <pre>def intersect(A,B,C,D):
    return ccw(A,C,D) != ccw(B,C,D) and ccw(A,B,C) != ccw(A,B,D)
    </pre>
