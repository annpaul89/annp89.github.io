<!-- MAIN CONTENT -->
<p>
    Being a backend engineer, I didn't seem to care too much about best practices when coding in Jquery or any front end technology for that matter
</p>
<p> 
    It, in most cases, made my code bulky and error prone. This was easily obvious when I refactored a simple implementation of serializing params to create a queyrstring.
</p>
<pre>
var startParam = 'start=' + start,
    stopParam = 'stop=' + stop,
    dateParam = 'date=' + date,
    params = startParam + '&' + stopParam + '&' + dateParam;
</pre>
<p>Since this serialization is done by pure string formatting, there can be edge cases where an & or other characters that need to be escaped are passed in the query string. Why bother when there are libraries for this purpose :) I went ahead and refactored it by using <code> jquery.param</code> </p>

<pre>
var paramsDict = { startParam: start,
                    stopParam: stop,
                    dateParam: date };
var params = $.param( paramsDict );
</pre>
