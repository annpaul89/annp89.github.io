    <p>Being a backend engineer, I didn't seem to care too much about best practices when coding in Jquery or any front end technology for that matter<p></p> It, in most cases, made my code bulky and error prone. This was easily obvious when I refactored a simple implementation of serializing params to create a queyrstring.</p>
    <pre>
        var startParam = 'start=' + start,
            stopParam = 'stop=' + stop,
            dateParam = 'date=' + date,
            params = startParam + '&' + stopParam + '&' + dateParam;
    </pre>
    <p>Since this serialization is done by pure string formatting, there can be edge cases where an & or other characters that need to be escaped are passed in the query string. Why bother when there are libraries for this purpose :) I went ahead and refactored it by using <code> jquery.param</code> </p>

      <pre>
        var paramsDict = { startParam: start,
                            stopParam: stop,
                            dateParam: date };
        var params = $.param( paramsDict );
      </pre>
