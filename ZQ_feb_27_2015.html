<p><ol>
    <span>
       <li> Immutability: <pre>
        x=23 
        y=x 
        x=2</pre> But <code>y</code> is still<strong> 23</strong>  </li> 
    </br>
<li> Memory is managed dynamically, </br>
<pre>
    x= 'hello'
    x= 'world'
</pre> 
                (Values live until reference dies) </br> 'hello' is cleaned up since it no longer has a reference. 
</br> 
<li><strong>Mutable aliasing</strong> Assignment never copies data, it simply creates ref</br>
<pre>
a = [1,2] 
b = a
</pre>
Only <em>one</em> list exists </br>
<pre>
a.append(200) 
print b  // [1,2,200] 
</pre> </br>
<li> 
<pre>
a=257
b=257 
a is b //False 
</pre>

Only if the var was <strong>less than </strong>257 then they are True as the compiler stores their address in the same location for efficiency</br> <li> 
              Names in python have no type [They live on the <strong>heap</strong>] </br> <li> Values in python have no scope [They libe on the <strong> stack</strong>]
