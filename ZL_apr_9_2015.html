	<h3>More Functions better than classes.</h3>
	<p> Functions that share the same state can live in a class.</br>

<strong>Smell an Anti-pattern:</strong> When there's only one <em>public</em> function in a class, the class can be removed and the function can be a global function.
</p>
<h3>Functions <strong>ARE NOT</strong> Procedures</h3> 
<strong>Rule of thumb: </strong>Function should should either return computed stuff or have a side-effect by mutating what it was passed </br> 
<strong>Smell an Anti-pattern:</strong> Replace chars and return no of chars replaced

<h3>Donâ€™t try solve everything </h3>
All edge cases/ all future cases </br>
Base function on use-case agreed to solve</br>
Testing smaller modules(functions) is much easy. So test, test, test!
