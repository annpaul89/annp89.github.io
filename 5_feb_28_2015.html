<!-- MAIN CONTENT -->
    <p>Today, I got to work with a friend to use Python libraries to scrape data from a Pokemon website
        [http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/].
        Since there's a lot of data and numbers associated with it,
        I thought it'd be fun to look into and explore. [Disclaimer: I do not play Pokemon and the most I know is that
        Pikachu is a very famous(?) Pokemon]</p>

    <p>The python packages needed are: <code>lxml</code> for HTML parsing and <code>urllib</code>
        to access the url as a HTML response.<p>
    <code>url = {url_name} <br>
        response = urllib.urlopen(url) <br>
        data = response.read() <br>
        tree = html.fromstring(data) <br>
    </code>
    <p>Essentially, we need to access the DOM element from which we want to scrap data using the xpath that leads to it. So if you've ever stumbled upon this path, </p>
    <p class="thick">Right click web-page -> Inspect Element -> Right on the HTML for the element you are searching, you'll notice an option called ->'Copy Xpath'.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, it won't work in some cases where the content you are searching for is in within a <code>table</code> tag.
    On inspecting the xpath, I noticed the <code>tbody</code> tag, which are tags inserted
    by the browser when not specified in the source code. So, I had to restructure the path, removing the tbody tags. </p>
    <p>
    Here's the xpath information for accessing a span element whose id is "By_leveling_up", going up to the parent node, accessing a sibling node
      and then traversing down 2 nested tables using indexes and accessing the content from the td element at index "13" for all the tr elements in
      that table.
    </p>
    <p class="text_width">
     <pre> tree.xpath('//span[@id="By_leveling_up"]/../following-sibling::table[1]/
         tr[2]/td[1]/table[1]/tr/td[13]/a/span/text()')</pre>
