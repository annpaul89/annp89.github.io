<!-- MAIN CONTENT -->
<p>
    As part of creating a tool to edit aggregate data by the hour, I came across an interesting problem when trying to split the total into 4 bukcets for each hour. 
</p>
<ol> 
    <li> How do we handle numbers that are not divisible by 4</li>
    <li> If the number is less than four, do we just set the last three buckets to 0 </li>
    <li> How can we create some variation so the patterns dont look alike, i.e., the intial buckets have higher numbers than the lower buckets</li>
</ol>

So I came up with the solution after couple of iterations.
First, the quick and easy solution. Divide the number by 4. If there's a remainder add it to the last bucket.

<pre>
    sub_count = total_count/4
    rem_count = total_count%4

    counts = [sub_count]*3+[sub_count+rem_count]
</pre>
This works but always makes the last bucket have a larger count which makes the distribution of counts generated almost uniform. This led to trying to randomize which bucket was gonna by selected.
<pre>

    count_list = defaultdict(list)
    choices = [0, 1, 2, 3]

    for i in xrange(0, total_count):
        count_list[random.choice(choices)].append(i)

    result_count_list = [len(count) for index, count in count_list.iteritems()]

    # For lower total_count, pad 0s
    if len(result_count_list) != 4:
        result_count_list += [0] * (4-len(result_count_list))

    return result_count_list
</pre>

Ugh! A lot of fluff. Why not just <strong>initialize the list with 0s</strong> ? 

<pre> 
    count_list = [0] * 4
    for r in xrange(total_count):
        count_list[random.randrange(0, 4)] += 1
    return count_list
</pre>
